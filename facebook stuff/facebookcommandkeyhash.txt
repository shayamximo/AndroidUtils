step 1: create hash key using (in C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin)
	keytool -exportcert -alias my_key_alias -keystore "C:\Users\Shaya\Google Drive\mximo\temp\version configuration\keys for publish\soho\soho.keystore" | "C:\Users\Shaya\Google Drive\mximo\temp\openssl\openssl-0.9.8k_X64\bin\openssl.exe" sha1 -binary | "C:\Users\Shaya\Google Drive\mximo\temp\openssl\openssl-0.9.8k_X64\bin\openssl.exe" base64

step 2:
	log to https://developers.facebook.com/
		user name: davidmazor@yahoo.com	
		pass: pnJ5ebzg

step 3:
	Apps -> create app and fill in details

step 4: settings -> add platform -> android

step 5: fill in details(look at other ready apps for examples) + "save changes"
		package name
		class name (com....MainActivity)
		mark single sign in
		contact email
		Key hashes(from step 1)
		
step 6: 
	Status + review:
	
	Do you want to make this app and all its live features available to the general public?
		check  yes
		
step 7:
	in strings.xml change app_id to what is says in APP ID on the site
	
step 8:
   run the demo app(FaceShare in current Directory), and if you get annoying exception, go to logcat and look for
	com.facebook.http.protocol.ApiException:
	it will have the key hash to PUT ON THE SITE AS THE HASH INSTEAD OF THE ONE THAT IS ORIGINALLY THERE!@

MESSUPS FROM EXPERIENCE:

1. in lamaloli AND loveandpride there was no "=" in the end, so just added it.
